Description: This program is a far cry from the original game, but the goal remains the same â€“ defeat Bowser and save the princess. The game simulation is carried out in a world that consists of a fixed number of levels. Mario must navigate the levels, encountering enemies and power ups, and collecting coins, before engaging a boss to move onto the next level.
